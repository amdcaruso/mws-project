#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, Amanda Cavallaro incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, she took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. She also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Specification

This project was updated by Amanda Cavallaro, as had been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues, it was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn't include any standard accessibility features, and it didn't work offline at all. 

### How to run this project

#### tl;dr 
1. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

#### Longer explanation
1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
